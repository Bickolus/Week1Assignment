# Week 1: Code Refactor Challenge

For the first week of the Coding Bootcamp, we were instructed to do the following:

Follow the Scout Rule (make it cleaner than before you came) and refactor the code so it meets the standards in web accessibility.

The codebase should be improved by:
1. Ensuring every link works properly
2. Making the CSS more efficient and properly consolidating the selectors and properties
3. Replacing the div tags in the HTML with semantic tags for better accessibility for things such as search engines
4. Include comments in each file for ease and clarity
